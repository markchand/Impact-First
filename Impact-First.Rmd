This stuff is complicated. It's complicated becuase we're not speaking clearly. 

Historically, U=C in private business. But more and more recent companies are U/=C. Most common are ad-driven tech companies. Any other company where customers are paying for access to someone, maybe?

<!-- https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C44&q=customers+and+users+two-sided+business+models&btnG= --> 

Credit scoring companies are an interesting example where U/=C. 

And education, arguably, if U=student and true C=companies hiring them. 

<!-- Maybe Emery, C., Kramer, T., & Tian, R. (2001). Customers vs. products: adopting an effective approach to business students. Quality Assurance in Education, 9(2), 110-115. --> 

Broadcast television is a U/=C model, too. Cable TV added an element where U=C, making them both--but it was thinking about user as potential customer that got us there. 

There are other ways in which customer might not equal user. Kids' toys, for example. Wedding rings, for example. College tuition. In the gap between user and customer, there is much money to be made. 

Social enterprises add another dimension, via philanthropy: Beneficiaries. Because social enterprises offer the promise of having some social impact, there is an extra layer of relationship to consider. 

Thinking clearly about this leads to a categorization of social enterprises based on the relationships among their users, customers, and beneficiaries. Sometimes they're all the same: Waterhealth International sells purification services to low-income residents, and are themselves the primary intended benficiary. Sometimes, especially in philanthropic instances, the customer, user and beneficiary are all distinct (example??). 

## Is this distinction clear? 
Yes, under certain circumstances. Sometimes groups have multiple revenue streams, and sometimes they have multiple intended beneficiaries. And sometimes they have multiple, distinct user bases. But more often than not, there is enough clarity about where the money is coming from, who is using a product or service, and who it is intended to benefit that we can draw pretty clear distinctions from within the universe of social enterprises, and maybe philanthropic efforts, too. 

## Is this distinction useful? 
Maybe. It may be that mapping out the relationships among these actors helps get us to categories that weren't obvious before, but which predict other things that we want to know about social enterprises: How to fund them, how to support them, how to regulate them, how to theorize about them, how to staff them, how to market them, how to lead them. 

<!-- Model this off of Discovery v Creation paper -->

So, here are the different models, with examples pulled from the investment portfolios of two groups: Techstars Impact, a network of investment funds that runs accelerators, and recently launched a social impact-focused fund; and Acumen Fund, a nonprofit that, for the most part, accepts grant dollars and then invests it in enterprises mostly in the developing world. This paper focuses on its India portfolio, for starters. ... and here's where they all fit, based on publicly available information. 

## Models 
C = B = U 
Bridgecare Finance	Techstars Impact
MDaaS Global	Techstars Impact
Better Living Technologies	Techstars Impact
Aarusha Homes	Acumen Fund in India
Basix Krishi	Acumen Fund in India
Greenway Grameen	Acumen Fund in India

Drishtee	Acumen Fund in India
Frontier Markets	Acumen Fund in India
Global Easy Water Products	Acumen Fund in India
Ignis Careers	Acumen Fund in India
Labournet	Acumen Fund in India
SEED Education Corporation	Acumen Fund in India

C = B /= U
Nobody? Franchise designed for employment, maybe? 

C /= B /= U 
Clair, maybe, if B = P 

Here are a few that are interesting enough to raise questions about the suitability of the model: 
Clair	Techstars Impact
Edubridge	Acumen Fund in India
Husk Power Systems	Acumen Fund in India
Asian Health Alliance	Acumen Fund in India
Avani Bio Energy	Acumen Fund in India
Ziqitza Health Care Limited	Acumen Fund in India

<!-- Get clarity (from Molly? Rob?) on Acumen Fund, and then use some of the TS companies as models --> 

<!--How to visualize this? Venn Diagram doesn't work. -->

Sometimes, beneficiary is the environment, broadly. That isn't the case with these groups, but you can imagine it being that way. 


## What might this help us predict? 
Funding needs and patterns. Hiring requirements. Strategy. Leadership requirements. Marketing requirements. Capital requirements. Regulatory requirements. 

## How might we apply this? 
Here's guesses at what we'd see, based on these categories
