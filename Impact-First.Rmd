## Outline 
* Obligatory paragraph about the rise of social entrepreneurship (?)
  * Or skip it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
* But we have a categorization problem 
  * Substantiantiate 
* This is our job as academics 
  * Substantiate
    * With current authors
    * With old authors
    * With John Gardner 
* What should a good categorization system do? 
  * Be useful 
  * Be clarifying 
  * Guide future research 
  * Predict outcomes 
  * Is this basically the same as good theory? 
* Here's how it's been done in other fields
  * Entrepreneurship 
  * Two-sided markets 
  * Couple other examples? 
* Here have been previous efforts in socent 
  * In academia
    * Focus on Alter 
    * Give some metrics for most-cited, maybe 
  * Outside of it 
    * Focus on GIIN 
    * Zoe's impact risk 
* They aren't working (feels shakiest)
  * They fail the above tests 
    * Is that true? 
  * No on is using them 
    * Is that true? One test that they fail: They still require subjective interpretation 
    
> Proposition 1: We're still a few rounds away from something useful enough for future researchers to build on, and for practitioners to think is useful 
  
* Unclear how to transition; look back at Lounsbury and Glenn for advice
